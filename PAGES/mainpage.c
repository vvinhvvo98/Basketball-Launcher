/**
 * @mainpage BACKGROUND
 *
 * @section motivation MOTIVATION
 * The objective of this project is to develop a software application that performs 
 * efficient data processing and provides insightful analytics. The application aims to 
 * be user-friendly, scalable, and maintainable.
 * 
 * @section detail OBJECTIVE
 * The project is divided into several modules, each responsible for different 
 * aspects of the application. The core functionalities include data collection, 
 * preprocessing, analysis, and visualization. The system architecture is designed 
 * to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new features.
 * 
 * @mainpage DESIGN
 * 
 * @section controller Controller
 * The controller module manages the overall flow of the application. It coordinates 
 * the activities between different modules, ensuring smooth execution of tasks. 
 * The controller is responsible for initializing the system, handling user inputs, 
 * and managing the lifecycle of the application.
 *
 * @section launcher Launcher
 * The launcher module serves as the entry point of the application. It initializes 
 * the necessary components and starts the main loop. The launcher is designed to be 
 * lightweight, with the primary responsibility of setting up the environment and 
 * invoking the controller.
 *
 * @mainpage RESULT
 * For detailed information on each module and its functionalities, please refer to 
 * the respective module documentation.
