The controller will use an STM32 Black\+Pill microcontroller with an IMU sensor attached to the user\textquotesingle{}s hand. It will send signals via Bluetooth to the launcher, allowing the launcher to receive the data and rotate according to the IMU sensor\textquotesingle{}s input. The data transfer includes the velocity of the angles, and the communication uses a UART connection between the HC-\/05 Bluetooth module. The controller also features buttons and an indicator LED, all mounted on a 3D-\/printed handle bracket. ~\newline




PICTURE UPDATE NEEDED\hypertarget{controller_detail_schematic}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{CONTROLLER PCBA}{CONTROLLER PCBA}}\label{controller_detail_schematic}
The PDF of this schematic is also attached with higher solution can be found in \href{ControllerSchematic.pdf}{\texttt{ PDF SCHEMATIC}}. Moreover, everything about PCBA design for this project can be found in the repositor link that is mentioned in the mainpage, or here for convinient\+: \href{https://github.com/vvinhvvo98/Basketball-Launcher/tree/main/Ball_Launcher_Controller}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/vvinhvvo98/\+Basketball-\/\+Launcher/tree/main/\+Ball\+\_\+\+Launcher\+\_\+\+Controller}} Below are the overall schematic and footprint of the PCBA that is used to integrate the STM32 Black\+Pill, mpu6050 IMU, HC-\/05, and LEDs together.
